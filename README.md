# Programming-Languages-Prolog-Assignment

This assignment was to solve a logic puzzle in C++ and in Prolog and output the correct answer, I know the documentation isn't perfect but should still be understandable.

Just run the C++ code to get the answer to the logic puzzle.

run the Prolog code with the query "?-solve(Batman,Dibii,Jake)" to get the answer.
